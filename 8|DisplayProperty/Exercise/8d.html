The reason we plus 4 in total width is that even though there is no margin displayed in "Computed", there is actually a 4px distance between two inputs! This distance is caused by the single space between two <input>s! For formatting purpose, we normally write two inputs in separate lines, which can cause the single space between two inputs! */
