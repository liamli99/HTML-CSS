        <!-- Note that three headers are like covering the divs, this is because fixed elements are removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the elements in the page layout!!!
            
        To fix this issue, we can add margin-top to the first div, but the best solution is to add padding-top to the body!!! -->
