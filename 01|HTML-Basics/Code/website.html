<button>Hello</button>

<!-- Note that button and link have a gap (single space) between them even if they have no margin! This is because their HTML codes are written in different lines and extra spaces and new lines are considered as 1 space! This always happens among inline-block elements!!! -->

<!-- The link is opened in a new tab because of target -->
