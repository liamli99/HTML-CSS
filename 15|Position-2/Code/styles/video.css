/* 
video-time is positioned relative to the thumbnail, but since thumbnail is an image which is not a container, we should choose thumbnail-row as the container and make it "relative"! Then video-time should be made "absolute"! 

Note that since video-time is absolute, it is removed from the normal document flow, so that it will not affect thumbnail!!! 

By doing this, top/right/bottom/left set the distance between video-time and thumbnail-row! Since thumbnail-row is inside grid, thumbnail-row takes up the same space as thumbnail! So that setting the distance between video-time and thumbnail-row is actually the same as setting the distance between video-time and thumbnail!!!
