    "## CSS Position\n",
    "The `position` property sets how an element is positioned in a document. We can then use `top`, `right` , `bottom`, and `left` properties to determine the final position of the elements!   \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `static`: This is the default value. The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. Static-positioned elements are not affected by the  `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `relative`: Same as `static`, the element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. However, `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties will cause the relative-positioned element to be pushed away from its original position, but unlike margin, other elements are not affected!!!\n",
    "(1) `top: 10px`: Place the element 10px from the top of its original position (push it down by 10px)! \n",
    "\n",
    "3. `fixed`: The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout! The element is positioned in the **browser window**, which means it stays in the same place when scrolling the page!!! We can use `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties to determine the final position of the fixed-position elements! \n",
    "(1) `top: 10px`: Place the element 10px from the top of the browser window (the distance between the top of the element and the top of the browser window is 10px)!\n",
    "(2) If we only set one of top and bottom and one of right and left, the element will only take up as much space as possible! But if we set both top and bottom or both right and left, the element will stretch!    \n",
    "(3) Note that using `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties are similar to setting the margins between element and browser window! If we set `top` + `bottom` (`left` + `right`), the actual height (width) of the element will resize when resizing the window!!! If we set `height` (`width`), the actual height (width) of the element will not resize when resizing the window! Sometimes we use a combination of top/right/bottom/left and width/height!      \n",
    "\n",
    "4. `absolute`: Same as `fixed`, the element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout! The element is positioned on the **web page**, which means it moves when scrolling the page!!! We can use `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties to determine the final position of the absolute-position elements! \n",
    "(1) `top: 10px`: Place the element 10px from the top of the page (the distance between the top of the element and the top of the page is 10px)!   \n",
    "(2) Other properties are similar to `fixed`!   \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a very important feature of `absolute`: If the absolute-position element is inside another positioned element (not `static`!), then the absolute-position element is positioned relative to its positioned ancestor! To be more specific:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) If `absolute` is inside `fixed`: The absolute element will be positioned relative to the fixed element! `top` is the distance between the top of absolute element and the top of fixed element! Thus the absolute element behaves like \"fixed\"!\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) If `absolute` is inside `relative`: The absolute element will be positioned relative to the relative element! `top` is the distance between the top of absolute element and the top of relative element! Thus the absolute element behaves like \"relative\"!   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sometimes the positioned element (`fix` or `relative`) is not a container, e.g. an image element, we cannot put the absolute element inside of it. If we still want the absolute element to be positioned relative to the positioned element, we can create a new div container to wrap both positioned element and absolute element!!! In the Youtube project, video-time and notifications-count are good examples!**\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage**\n",
    "(1) `fixed`: Stay fixed when scrolling the page!\n",
    "(2) `relative`: (1) Minor adjustments from original position (2) If we want to position an (absolute) element relative to a `static` element, we should make that static element `relative`!!!\n",
    "(3) `absolute`: (1) Precise position on the page (2) If we want to position an element relative to another positioned element (`fixed` or `relative`), we should make that element `absolute` and put it inside another positioned element so that it is positioned relative to its ancestor!!!\n"

    "1. Elements with a higher z-index appear in front of elements with a lower z-index. The default z-index is 0. \n",
